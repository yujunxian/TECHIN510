# TempoLog - A Rhythmic Time and Emotion Tracker

## Project Scope

TempoLog is a lightweight, web-based time and emotion management tool built with Streamlit. It helps users log tasks, track time spent, and record emotional state upon completion. The system evaluates task efficiency and visualizes daily performance through a dynamic “tempo spectrum,” helping users reflect on productivity and mental rhythms.

## Target Users

- Students with structured study goals (e.g., exam preparation)
- Remote workers managing solo workflows
- Anyone seeking to increase time awareness and emotional insight

## Key Features

### 1. Task Management
- Input task name and expected duration in minutes
- Start, pause, and end timer with one click
- Prompt for mood selection upon completion

### 2. Efficiency and Emotion Logging
- Efficiency score = (Expected Time / Actual Time) × 100%
- Performance rating: High, Normal, or Low
- Mood options: Happy, Neutral, Stressed

### 3. Data Storage
- Local storage using SQLite
- Records task name, start/end time, mood, and efficiency

### 4. Tempo Spectrum Visualization
- X-axis: Task time span
- Y-axis: Task name
- Bar color represents mood
- Color intensity indicates efficiency (darker = more efficient)

### 5. Optional Extensions
- Integration with external APIs (e.g., mood-based music suggestions)
