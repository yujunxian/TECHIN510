# TECHIN510 Project: TempoLog

## Project Objectives
TempoLog is a web-based time management tool designed to transform task tracking into a visual and emotional rhythm chart. Users input tasks with expected durations, start built-in timers, and upon completion, the system calculates task efficiency automatically and allows users to select their current mood. These inputs produce a daily "tempo spectrum" reflecting productivity and emotional state.

## Target Users and Their Needs
### Target Users:
- Students
- Remote workers
- People seeking self-awareness in their time management

### User Needs:
- A structured and intuitive method for tracking daily tasks
- Immediate visual and emotional feedback on their productivity
- Tools to understand personal productivity trends over time

## Key Deliverables
- A responsive web-based application (Streamlit or HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Task management interface with built-in timers
- Automatic calculation of efficiency based on planned vs. actual completion time
- Mood selection upon task completion
- Daily tempo spectrum visualizations
- Data storage (local or cloud-based solutions such as Firebase)
- Complete GitHub project repository with clear documentation

## Special Constraints
- Timer functionality must be accurate, reliable, and easy to operate
- Efficiency scoring logic should be clear and intuitive (e.g., 'high efficiency' â‰¤ 90% of expected task time)
- Secure and responsible handling of user mood and productivity data
- Accessible and inclusive visualizations for diverse users
- Optional integration with external APIs (such as weather data) for additional context

## Expected Outcome
Upon completion, users will be able to view an intuitive visual summary of their daily rhythm, combining productivity insights and emotional reflections. This visual representation will help users recognize productivity patterns, enhance productivity and understand their own patterns over time.
